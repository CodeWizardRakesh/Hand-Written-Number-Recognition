# Hand-Written-Number-Recognition
   Welcome to the Handwritten Number Recognition project! This project is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits using Deep Learning techniques and a user-friendly graphical interface. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow for DeepLearning and the Pillow library for image processing, I've created a robust system for accurately recognizing handwritten digits.


## What's it all about
- We understand words and numbers through our natural human intelligence.
- The signals from the eyes are processed by neurons of the brain along with the memory stored by learning things from the past.
- Similarly, a computer can also be trained to recognize numbers, words, animals, etc., by itself!
  - We call it Artificial Intelligence.
  - This is achieved by Deep Learning, which is a subset of Machine Learning.
  - It also involves Computer Vision.
- ***This is a simple project which uses computer vision to recognize and understand the single digit number written by a Human.***



 
## How it was made?
- This project utilizes the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm.
- Feature Extraction.
- The neural network architecture includes:
  - An input layer.
  - Two dense layers.
  - An output layer containing 10 neurons.
- The model is trained using the ***MNIST dataset***, which comprises 60,000 handwritten single-digit numbers.
- Image pixels are converted into arrays and fed into the input layer neurons.
- The output layer provides the probabilities for each digit.
- The predicted number corresponds to the neuron with the highest probability.

## Graphical User Interface
- I've used Tkinter for creating a simple and aesthetic GUI which makes the application user friendly.
