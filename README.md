# Hand-Written-Number-Recognition
   Welcome to the Handwritten Number Recognition project! This project is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits using Deep Learning techniques and a user-friendly graphical interface. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow for DeepLearning and the Pillow library for image processing, I've created a robust system for accurately recognizing handwritten digits.


## What's it all about
We understand words and numbers through our natural human intelligence.
 The signals from the eyes are processed by neurons of the brain along with the memory stored by learning things from past.
Similarly, a computer can also be trained to recognise the number ,words and animals etc by itself!. We call it Artificial Intelligence.
This is achieved by Deep Learning which is subset of Machine learning and also using the Computer Vision.


 
## Peception:
	the way the information is organised,interpreted and consciously experienced.
