# Hand-Written-Number-Recognition
   Welcome to the Handwritten Number Recognition project! This project is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits using Deep Learning techniques and a user-friendly graphical interface. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow for DeepLearning and the Pillow library for image processing, I've created a robust system for accurately recognizing handwritten digits.


## What's it all about
	if an interrogator cannot distinguish between machine and a human then the machine is assumed to be intelligent.

## Peception:
	the way the information is organised,interpreted and consciously experienced.
