# Hand-Written-Number-Recognition
   Welcome to the Handwritten Number Recognition project! This project is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits using Deep Learning techniques and a user-friendly graphical interface. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow for DeepLearning and the Pillow library for image processing, I've created a robust system for accurately recognizing handwritten digits.


## What's it all about
- We understand words and numbers through our natural human intelligence.
- The signals from the eyes are processed by neurons of the brain along with the memory stored by learning things from the past.
- Similarly, a computer can also be trained to recognize numbers, words, animals, etc., by itself!
  - We call it Artificial Intelligence.
  - This is achieved by Deep Learning, which is a subset of Machine Learning.
  - It also involves Computer Vision.
-**This is a simple project which uses computer vision to recognize and understand the single digit number written by a Human.



 
## Peception:
	the way the information is organised,interpreted and consciously experienced.
